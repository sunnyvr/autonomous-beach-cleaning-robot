# autonomous-beach-cleaning-robot
Final project for my undergrad.
- The robot consists of ultra sonic sensor, PIR sensor, control unit, roller broom fan, D.C motor, dustpan and frame. The bot starts to move forward, and the broom fan starts to rotate. The bot keeps collecting the scrap by using the rotation of broom fan. The detection of obstacles is done by the ultrasonic sensors and the PIR sensor.
